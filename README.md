Your small URLs are recorded in a list, where you may access, edit, or delete them as needed.

TinyApp hashes passwords to securely manage your login details. 

## Analytics
TinyApp includes URL access analytics, which allows you to view the use statistics of your small URLs. This includes total visits, the number of unique visitors, and a record of the times and users that accessed your URLs. To view these, simply click on the edit button for the link. Access records are included at the bottom of the URL edit page.
